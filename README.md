Algae is a generative semi-random walk script made in processing and will be ported to p5js. 

Algae goal is to let the buyer control its final output. The artwork will progressively trace its path until the user presses the return key and the artwork will be minted and sent to their wallet address.

In brief the whole idea is to let the user control the final visual output, and then rarities will be based on what most user decides, where there be more simple pieces or complex ones?

I’ve already implemented some other rarities or traits. So far the “classic” artwork will be white background and black line, but there are currently other 3 color combinations that are randomnly triggered. ( I plan to add 2 more )

Also there’s a random chance that the line will change its color at a random time and for a random length during the artwork progression. So if users decide to finish their artwork early to keep it minimal they might miss out on a bi-color line as well.

The speed of which the artwork will progress is currently quite slow, so to achieve a very complex artwork the script needs to be left tracing its path for a while, making the complex artwork more difficult to achieve. But leaving early might mean loosing some rare traits :).

So it’s up to you, are you a minimalist lover or a complexity seeker?

the choice is yours
